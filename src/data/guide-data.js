      "If there is one sector that is always thriving, regardless of the economic environment of the country, it is Agriculture. After all, food is one of the basic necessities of human beings for survival. So the agricultural sector is considered to be the prime sector for any nation. More so in a country like India which is known as an agricultural country because farming is the backbone of the Indian economy.\n\nThe importance of agriculture in India:\n- More than 60% to 70% of the Indian population is dependent on agriculture and its allied activities for their livelihood\n- The agricultural sector provides employment to more than 52% of the total labor force in the country\n- The contribution of agriculture to India’s total GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is between 14% to 15%.\n\nHence, it goes without saying that agriculture can potentially be a feasible business idea in India. Also known as Agribusiness, an agricultural business includes farming, production, marketing, and management of agricultural commodities like grains, vegetables, fruits, and livestock. From a broader perspective, an agribusiness also consists of resource management, conservation, ranching, and sales of agricultural produce.\n\nThe main causes of a surge in Agribusiness in the past few years:\n- With the consistent rise of E-commerce, home delivery grocery stores have created an opportunity for agriculture enthusiasts to start their own farms with the help of agriculture experts\n- The ever-growing population has increased the demand for food produce\n- Startups have come up with the innovative idea of growing organic produce on terraces and balconies of homes\n- The growing awareness and popularity of high-quality organic farm produce that sells at a high value in the market.\n\nThe agricultural business can be predominantly categorized into three main sectors mentioned below:\n1. Production resources, which include seed, feed, fertilizer, energy, equipment, machinery, and the like\n2. Agricultural commodities like raw or processed items of food and fiber\n3. Facilitative services like insurance, marketing, credit, processing, storage, packaging, transportation, etc.\n\nHowever, just like any other business, starting an agricultural business also needs systematic planning and strategizing to achieve the desired goals.\n\nA Step by Step guide on drafting an Agribusiness business:\n\nStep 1 – Decide which, amongst the below, agriculture business idea suits you the most:\n- Urban agriculture, which means practicing agriculture in urban areas and its surrounding regions.\n- Herb, fruit or vegetable farming\n- Production of Botanical pesticide\n- Organic gardening\n- Field crop farming\n- Distribution of fertilizers\n- Dairy farming\n- Poultry farming\n\nStep 2 – Obtain the chosen farming land’s proof of ownership or lease agreement and secure a farm map which includes farm boundaries and watering points.\n\nStep 3 – Research and identify the potential markets and their requirements to cater to.\n\nStep 4 – Take into account your expertise, ability, knowledge, and access to professional assistance before finalizing the commodity for your business plan.\n\nStep 5 – Calculate the short-term as well as long-term economic potential, viability, and future opportunities of the chosen commodities and source information accordingly.\n\nStep 6 – Once you have zeroed in on the commodities, the next logical step would be to identify resources that need to be obtained to manufacture your chosen commodities.\n\nStep 7 – Once you have finalized the agribusiness sector of your choice, you will have to get your business registered with its chosen operational name.\n\nStep 8 – Arguably the most vital step in starting any new business is arranging the required finances from a reliable source to ensure smooth operations of the business.\n\nAgriculture loans in India:\nAn agribusiness loan is nothing but an overdraft facility that can be used as working capital for activities related to agriculture like farming and cultivation. Agricultural loans in India are usually low-interest loans that can be availed by farmers. The repayment tenure of an agricultural loan differs from lender to lender. The loan can be repaid in monthly, half-yearly, or yearly installments.\n\nUses of Agribusiness loans:\n- Purchasing farming and irrigation equipment\n- Buying cattle and livestock\n- Purchase land for agricultural activities\n- Storage and warehousing expenses\n- Marketing expenses\n- Transportation costs\n- Managing day-to-day operations.\n\nSources of Agribusiness loans:\nIn India, financial institutions like government and private banks, co-operative societies, and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC) like Lendingkart provide convenient agribusiness loans.\n\nBenefits of Agribusiness loans from Lendingkart:\n- Convenient and flexible loan\n- Simplified documentation\n- Easy loan repayment terms as per the borrower’s income\n- Zero hidden costs\n- Attractive interest rates\n- Fast processing\n\nEligibility criteria for an Agriculture Loan:\n- Applicant should be between 18 – 70 years old.\n- Applicant should utilize the loan for the cultivation of agricultural land\n\nDocuments required to avail an Agriculture Loan:\n- ID proof – PAN card/Aadhar card/Ration card/Driving license/Voter ID\n- Address proof – Bank statement/No more than 3 months old utility bill/Ration card/Driving license/Passport\n- Land ownership proof.",

Yes, people have been dubious about Ayurveda's healing capabilities. However, when Naomi Campbell, the British supermodel, landed in Kerala last year, it was an affirmation of the efficacy of this powerful healing system.Perhaps, the most popular objective of ayurvedic healing is the removal of toxins from the body so it can be more immune to diseases. However, the best part is that Ayurveda rejuvenates not just your body but also your mind and soul While there exist several ayurvedic hospitals across India, Ayurveda is practiced in its authentic and most traditional form in Kerala.

There are nearly 924 ayurvedic health tourism centers across the 14 districts of Kerala, offering numerous healing techniques.Potential Benefits Of Ayurveda & Common TreatmentsFrom anxiety to asthma, arthritis to digestive problems, and eczema to diabetes, Ayurveda has been found to cure almost all health problems. Some popular ayurvedic treatments include Abhyangam, Njavarakkizhi, and Dhara. Typically, Abhyangam involves massaging your entire body using ayurvedic oils to improve blood circulation and thereby reduce stress. On the other hand, Njavarakkizhi is a body polishing therapy that will revitalize your skin complexion. Dhara also involves ayurvedic oils, but the oils are made to sit on your head to improve memory, sleep quality, and relieve stress.With Ayurveda's growing popularity, many private players have entered the scene. In most health centers, Ayurveda is practiced in the most traditional form, and unlike the common misconception, they don't act as massage parlors. Instead, these centers are genuine healthcare providers that practice wellness and recreation as a part of their service. However, some of the best ayurvedic healthcare centers include Vaidyaratnam, Kottakkal, Pankajakasthuri, Kairali, and Shanthigiri.The Best Time For Ayurvedic Treatment In Kerala While the festivities never cease in Kerala, Keralites take a respite in the month of June, when the season switches from summer to monsoon, which lasts for nearly two months.

One treatment that is of particular importance here is Panchakarma—an ayurvedic therapy performed to remove toxins from the body.Often, the stressful lifestyle that people live every day results in the accumulation of toxins in the body that causes health issues. Panchakarma flushes out these toxins and restores vitality.Ayurveda is also beneficial for skin-related issues.

      "India is the third largest producer of rubber in the world. It is the fourth largest consumer of natural rubber. It is the fifth largest consumer of natural rubber and synthetic rubber together in the world. India is the world's largest manufacturer of reclaim rubber. India and China are the only two countries in the world which have the capacity to consume the entire indigenous production of natural rubber. To know more about India's export opportunities regarding rubber products and also to have an idea about global rubber industry, take the Rubber Industry Overview. Rubber Consumption in India. The following industrial sector consume most of the rubber products. Automotive tyre sector: 50% consumption of all kinds of rubbers. Bicycles tyres and tubes: 15%. Footwear: 12%. Belts and hoses: 6%. Camelback and latex products: 7%. Other products: 10%. Indian Rubber Market. India’s production varies between 6 and 7 lakh tons annually which amounts to Rs. 3000 crores. Seventy percent of the total rubber production in India is in the form of Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS). This is also imported by India accounting for 45% of the total import of rubber. The Indian rubber industry has a turnover of Rs 12000 crores. Most of the rubber production is consumed by the tyre industry which is almost 52% of the total production of India. Among the states, Kerala is the leading consumer of rubber, followed by Punjab and Maharashtra. The exports of Indian natural rubber have increased tremendously over the years and have reached 76000 tons in 2003-04. Though, India is one of the leading producers of rubber but it still imports rubber from other countries. At present, India is importing around 50000 tons of rubber annually.

These units are manufacturing more than 35000 rubber products, employing 400 hundred thousand people, which also includes 22000 technically qualified support personnel, contributing Rs. 40 billions to the National Exchequer through taxes, duties and other levies. The Indian Rubber Industry plays a vital role in the Indian national economy. The rubber plantation sector in India produces over 630 hundred thousand tones of natural rubber and there is a projected production of more than one million tones in near future. This has helped in the radical and rapid growth of the Indian rubber industry. This prospect of growth is further enhanced by a boom in the vehicle industry, improved living standards of the people and rapid over-all industrialization. The per capita consumption of rubber in India is only 800 grams compared to 12 to 14 kilos in Japan, USA and Europe. So far as consumption of rubber products is concerned, India is far from attaining any saturation level. This is another factor leading to tremendous growth prospects of the industry in the years to come.",
