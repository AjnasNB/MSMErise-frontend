        India Rubber Industry Overview
        There are about 6000 unit comprising 30 large scale, 300 medium scale and around 5600 small scale and tiny sector units. These units are manufacturing more than 35000 rubber products, employing 400 hundred thousand people, which also includes 22000 technically qualified support personnel, contributing Rs. 40 billions to the National Exchequer through taxes, duties and other levies. The Indian Rubber Industry plays a vital role in the Indian national economy. The rubber plantation sector in India produces over 630 hundred thousand tones of natural rubber and there is a projected production of more than one million tones in near future. This has helped in the radical and rapid growth of the Indian rubber industry. This prospect of growth is further enhanced by a boom in the vehicle industry, improved living standards of the people and rapid over-all industrialization. The per capita consumption of rubber in India is only 800 grams compared to 12 to 14 kilos in Japan, USA and Europe. So far as consumption of rubber products is concerned, India is far from attaining any saturation level. This is another factor leading to tremendous growth prospects of the industry in the years to come.
